## Contact Before, During, After the Workshop

If you have questions or concerns leading up to or after the workshop, you can get in touch in a number of ways:

- If you feel comfortable doing so, please open an issue on this GitHub repository, particularly with any questions dealing with workshop preparation or any installation issues. This allows multiple workshop leaders to respond as able, and other participants can also learn (since we're sure the same questions will come up multiple times): https://github.com/cmh2166/SWIB17LODintro/issues (this will require that you login or create a free account with GitHub).
- Alternatively, you can email all the workshop leaders - [Christina Harlow](mailto:cmharlow@gmail.com), and [Huda Khan](mailto:hjk54@cornell.edu) - with questions if you feel uncomfortable using GitHub issues.

During the workshop, we will indicate the best ways to get help or communicate a question/comment - however, this workshop is intended to be informal, so feel free to speak up or indicate you have a question at any time.

## Our Expectations of You

To keep this workshop a safe and inclusive space, we ask that you review and follow the [the Recurse Center Social Rules (aka Hacker School Rules)](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).

## Participant Requirements

We request that all participants **bring their own laptop**, preferably one you have installation or admin privileges on, to the workshop. The laptop should have the software listed below installed as well as an up-to-date modern web browser (basically, not Internet Explorer). If you have any issues with the requested set-up, please contact us ASAP using the [communication methods detailed above](#contact-before-during-after-the-workshop).
